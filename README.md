KISS Persistent Login
=====================

A Persistent Login Mechanism

This is a "Keep It Simple Stupid" persistent login mechanism for codeigniter, a.k.a."Remeber Me" login.

I built this to show how easy a persistent login can be built and deployed. 
Features a register form to register new users, of course the login form too! 
This demo uses the built in php password hashing function for storing the login credentials
and makes use of the php openssl_random_pseudo_bytes function to generate random persistent cookie values.

This may not be the most secure method of handling a persistent login method, but the idea was to implement a very simple
"Remember Me?" functionality. More of a starting point or reference. 

Hope this helps!
